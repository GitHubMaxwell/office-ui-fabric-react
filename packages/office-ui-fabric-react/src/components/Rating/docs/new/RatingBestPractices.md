### Layout

- Make it clear which product the rating pertains to by making sure the layout and grouping are clear when several products are on the page.
- Don’t use the rating component for data that has a continuous range, such as the brightness of a photo. Instead, use a slider.

### Content

- Use a five-star rating system.
- Label shouldn’t include a color and should follow sentence casing.
