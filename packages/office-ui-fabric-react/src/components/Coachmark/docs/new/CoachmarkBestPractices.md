### Layout

- Only one Coachmark and TeachingBubble combo should be displayed at a time.
- Coachmarks can be stand-alone or sequential. Sequential Coachmarks should be used sparingly, to walk through complex multi-step interactions. It is recommended that a sequence of Coachmarks does not exceed three steps.
- Coachmarks are designed to only hold TeachingBubbles.
- Coachmark size, color, and animation should not be altered.
