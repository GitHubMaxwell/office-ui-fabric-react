### Layout

- Use a drop-down menu when there are multiple choices that can be collapsed under one title. Or if the list of items is long or when space is constrained.
- Use a drop-down when the selected option is more important than the alternatives (in contrast to radio buttons where all the choices are visible putting more emphasis on the other options.)

### Content

- Use sentence-style capitalization for drop-down menu labels and options.
- Labels should describe what can be found in the menu.
- Use shortened statements or single words as menu options.
- If there isn’t a default option, use “Select an option” as placeholder text.
- If “None” is an option, include it.
- Write the choices using parallel construction.
