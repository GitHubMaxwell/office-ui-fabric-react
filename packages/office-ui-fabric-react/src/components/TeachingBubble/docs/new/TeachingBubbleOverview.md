A teaching bubble (control name: TeachingBubble) brings attention to a new or important feature, with the goal of increasing engagement with the feature. A TeachingBubble typically follows a Coachmark.

Use TeachingBubbles sparingly. Consider how frequently people will see it, and how many theyâ€™ll see across their entire experience.
