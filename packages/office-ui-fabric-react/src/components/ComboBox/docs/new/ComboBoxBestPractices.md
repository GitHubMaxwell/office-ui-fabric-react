### Layout

- Use a combo box when there are multiple choices that can be collapsed under one title, when the list of items is long, or when space is constrained.
- Use a combo box when the selected option is more important than the alternatives (in contrast to option (radio) buttons, where all the choices are visible, putting more emphasis on the other options).

### Content

- Combo boxes contain shortened statements or words.
- Donâ€™t use punctuation at the end of the sentence.
