### Layout

- Don't use a Slider for binary settings.
- Don't create a continuous Slider if the range of values is large.
- Don't use for a range of three values or less.
- Display sliders as a horizontal or vertical track with options on either side. To make a choice, a knob or lever is dragged toward one end or the other, indicating the current value. Marks on the Slider bar can show values and people can choose where they want to drag the knob or lever to set the value.

### Content

- Include a label indicating what value the Slider changes.
- Use step points (or tick marks) if you don't want the Slider to allow arbitrary values between minimum and maximum.
