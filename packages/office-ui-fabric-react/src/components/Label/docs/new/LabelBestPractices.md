### Layout

- Labels should be close to the control they’re paired with. Some controls, such as TextField, Dropdown, or Toggle, already have Labels incorporated, but other components may optionally add a label if it helps inform people of the control’s purpose.

### Content

- Labels should describe the purpose of the control.
- Use sentence casing. For example, “First name”.
- Be short and concise.
- When adding a label to components, use the text as a noun or short noun phrase.
- Don’t use labels as instructional text. For example, “Click to get started”.
